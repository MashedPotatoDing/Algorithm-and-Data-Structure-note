Recently, I ocassionally found that I have stored many codes of competitive-programming problems since high school and most of them are made up of many advanced algorithms and data structures.
Thus, I made up my mind to collect my codes to make them templates and create a note of mine to record the algorithms and data structures I have learnt in high school and university.

I will keep updating this in the following time in order to improve and enrich it.
